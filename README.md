Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention

### MAIN FEATURES

- Users can delete their red-flag or intervention records.
- Users can add geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention records.
- Users can change the geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) attached to their red-flag or intervention records.
- Admin can change the status of a record to either under investigation, rejected (in the event of a false claim) or resolved (in the event that the claim has been investigated and resolved).
